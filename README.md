# Option Pricing with Monte Carlo Methods
This paper aims to present the various option pricing models using Monte Carlo Processes, beginning with the classic Black-Scholes-Merton model and building more complex models by adding stochastic variables to recreate the stochastic reality of financial markets. I will then describe the differences between competing models by highlighting each of their key innovations and will follow-up by comparing them in terms of option pricing.

The code for this paper was written in Matlab.
